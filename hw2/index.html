			<b>Question 1:</b><br>
			The casteljau algorithm recursively linearly interpolates the points until we reach <br>
			a single point which lies on the bezier curve. For example, on 4 points (abcd), we interpolate<br>
			ab, bc, cd to get (efg), which we then interpolate as ef, fg to get (hi) which we interpolate into the final point.<br>
			The algorithm uses a parameter t which gets passed into the interpolation function. <br>
			By drawing all values of the point for t:[0, 1], we get all the points on the bezier curve. <br>
			We implement this by filling in the evaluatestep, which performs one level of interpolation (i.e. abcd -> efg). <br>
			We then call this function everytime the user presses a key.<br>

			<b>Question 2:</b><br>
			First, for this problem we get a N x N grid of points, and have parameters of u and v both between [0, 1].<br>
			In order to extrapolate the casteljau algorithm to the surfaces, we first call it along one set of axes, so N calls on N points, <br>
			using parameter u as the interpolation parameter for this axis. This creates a set of points which lie on the bezier curves<br>
			in the direction of that axis. We then call the algorithm on this set of points, using the parameter v as the interpolation parameter.<br>
			This gives us a point which lies on the bezier surface for the N x N grid, and evaluating for all values (or enough values) of u, v gives us<br>
			the bezier (or at least approximate) surface.<br>

			<b>Question 3:</b><br>
			In order to do area-weighted normals, we take advantage of the fact that the cross product gives us 2x the area of the triangle <br>
			defined by the vectors (as it gives the area of the parallelogram) in the direction of the normal vector. We iterate along the half edges <br>
			around the vertex which, taking the cross product and summing these vectors together. We then return the normalized unit vector in the direction of this<br>
			cumulative vector, thus returning the area normalized normal vector at this vertex. <br>

			<b>Question 4:</b><br>
			I started by drawing a diagram labeling the vertices as abcd, and half edges as xy to indicate x->y, with its respective twin being yx. <br>
			I then reassigned everything I believed needed to be reassigned. I did forget a few things/made some mistakes in the process, one of which being<br>
			assigning some vertices to the wrong halfedge, which came up later when I noticed after a split/flip vertices wouldn't be pointing at any of their half edges.<br>

			<b>Question 5:</b><br>
			Similar to problem 4, I started by drawing out a diagram of the original abcd mesh and the abcd + m mesh, as well as <br>
			adding in the necessary half edges, and then going into the code and creating/reassigning various mesh elements. One mistake I <br>
			remember making was assigning both faces to the same half edge on accident, which meant splitting created everything else correctly, but <br>
			it left a whole in one of the halves.<br>

			<b>Question 6:</b><br>
			For this question, I went back and added an "is_split" element into the Edge element in halfEdgeMesh, to make sure when flipping to not consider these points. <br>
			Otherwise I mostly followed the steps outlined in the problem, by iterating through the edges and computing the new positions of the old vertices. Then I went through <br>
			the edges again splitting all the ones needed, as well as setting the new position for the new vertex in the corresponding. Then I went through all the edges on final time,<br>
			to flip the edges that needed to be flipped, and setting all the class elements back to their default states. Finally I went through all the vertices, setting them to their <br>
			new positions. For debugging, one thing I did was disabling the new position assignment to check if the splitting was working correctly. This allowed me to identify a problem <br>
			leftover from problem 4 which led to some weird denting patterns. Once I fixed this I re-enabled the position setting.
